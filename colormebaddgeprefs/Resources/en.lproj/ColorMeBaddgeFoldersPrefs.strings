Highest Badge: Uses the color of the first highest-numbered badge in the folder. \U2020

First Badge: Uses the color of the first badge in the folder. \U2020

Last Badge: Uses the color of the last badge in the folder. \U2020

Random Badge: Uses the color of a random badge in the folder.  Since this applies recursively, the badge color may come from any badged application within the folder, or subfolders of the folder.

Average Color: Uses the average color of all numeric badges in the folder.

Weighted Average Color: Uses the weighted average color of all numeric badges in the folder.  Badges will contribute to the average color proportionally to their badge value.

Folder Minigrid: Treats the folder icon as an app icon, and generates colors for it according to your app badge colorization settings.  (May not work as expected with tweaks that replace the folder icon.)

Random Colors: Generates a random badge and text color.

\U2020 If folder icons are manually reordered, the folder badge color may no longer be as expected until the badge is redrawn.";
